# 🏦 Loan Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details like income, credit history, and employment.

## 📁 Project Files
- `loan_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and output
- `loan_approval_data.csv`: Dataset used (if included)

## 📊 Problem Statement
Banks face huge risks when approving loans. By automating the loan approval process using ML models, we can reduce human error and speed up decisions.

## 🚀 Solution
We use data preprocessing and a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest) to predict loan status.

## 📌 Features Used
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term
- Credit History
- Property Area

## ✅ Model Accuracy
Achieved **X% accuracy** on test data.
